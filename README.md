# ATM-GuardAI: AI-Powered Surveillance System 🎥🔒

> A comprehensive AI-driven surveillance solution for ATM security with real-time threat detection using Deep Learning

---

## Project Overview

**ATM-GuardAI** is an intelligent surveillance system designed to enhance security at ATM locations.  
It uses advanced computer vision and deep learning models to detect suspicious activities such as:

- People wearing helmets (potential robbery indicator)
- People wearing masks (potential disguise)
- Abnormal face patterns (potential threats)

The system provides real-time alerts to security personnel through a centralized dashboard, enabling rapid response.
